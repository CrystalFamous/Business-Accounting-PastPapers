8 marks and 12 marks Questions

Analyse problems a business could experience in its first year of trading. [8]

    • establish and build a customer base of loyal returning customers.
    • establish itself in the market.
    • effectively manage cash flow : generate sufficient working capital.
    • establish good relations with suppliers.
    • follow an effective pricing strategy that allows the business to compete effectively.

Analysis

    • lack of cash and working capital
    • uncompetitive production
    • inability to effectively market the business
    • insufficient demand to survive
    • failure to secure external finance
    • inability to repay start-up capital

Note: Write about how important or how it can be solved

Discuss whether market research will reduce problems that might be 
experienced by a new start-up business. [12]

Note: Include Knowledge,Analysis,App,Evaluation

    • Definition and methods of research [2]
    • Ways in which new business problems could be reduced by market
      research could include (prior to start-up and in the early period of
      trading.)
    • Better understanding of your target market.
    • Identify and keep up with market trends.
    • Set realistic targets for sales and revenue.
    • Make better informed marketing decisions (4Ps).
    • Better identify specific problems : sales fall due to new competitor,
      or substitute produce now available.
    • Identify new business opportunities.

    Hints:

        Market research then has the potential to provide more accurate information:
        data relating to potential customers,
        existing and potential competitors.
        products, marketing opportunities: 
            that may well reduce risk and facilitate
            more confident business decision making.
        It is, however, expensive (particularly primary market research) and new
        start-up businesses may not have the finance or the inclination to engage in
        extensive market research.
    
    Evaluation:

        ALSO not all problems experienced by a new start up business will be
        problems that can be solved by market research 
        e.g. the internal management of the new business may be inadequate, sudden changes
        in the external environment may present significant problems for a new
        business such as recession and new competition, new technology etc.
        
Analyse how any one stakeholder group could use both an
income statement and a statement of financial position.

    Introduction:
        A review of the contents of Income Statements (cost of sales, gross
        profit, operating profit, profit for the year, retained earnings)

        Statement of financial position (current assets, non-current assets,
        current liabilities, working capital, net assets, non-current liabilities,
        reserves and equity.
        • the statements contain important accounting information and assists
            the following:
            - informs decision-making knowledge of profit level assists 
            - decisions on whether to invest in growth.
            - helps to monitor progress against targets / plans / budgets,
            - assists comparisons with previous years’ performance.
            - identifies cash flows, identifies where costs need reducing and
            - reserves increasing.
    Reasons:
        • employees can review the progress of the business.
        • assists investors to decide to further invest, or not.
        • government can see if the correct amount of tax has been paid.
        • suppliers can assess the health of a business.
        • facilitates comparisons with other companies' results.
        • the quantitative information and measures contained within these
        statements assists internal and external stakeholders to take a view
        of the absolute and relative strength of a business.
        • these are metrics so, of course, have their limitations and answers
        may well question the level of usefulness, 
        referring to some
        limitations: historic, inaccurate, misleading etc.:
        these comments could well act as a bridge into the answer to
        Section (b) of this question.

Discuss the view that the quantitative information in published accounts
does not present a complete picture of business performance.

    Note: Talk about difference between quantitative & qualitative w/ examples

    • discussion of the limitations of quantitative measures of
    performance as provided in published accounts leading to an
    incomplete picture of business performance.
    • a focus on the past : not the present or future.
    • measurement of the metrics can lead to window
    dressing.
    • you only count what can be counted and other information is left out

    - one of the main reasons that performance information and measures
    - are produced is for a company to learn, change, and improve and
    - quantitative measures may not be sufficient.

    - quantitative measures may well focus only on internal business
    - activity ignore external issues such as customer levels of satisfaction
    - and competitor positions.

    Evaluation:
        • it is argued that quantitative information / performance measures
        need to be complemented with qualitative information (internal and
        external)
        - • the ‘balanced scorecard’ approach of Kaplan suggests a mixture of
        -   quantitative and qualitative KPIs.:
                ```The term balanced scorecard (BSC) refers to a strategic management performance 
                metric used to identify and improve various internal business functions and
                their resulting external outcomes.
                Used to measure and provide feedback to organizations,
                Company personnel can use this information to make better decisions 
                for the future of their organizations.```
        • qualitative information suggested on the management of human
        resources (culture, quality of management) on product / service
        quality, on brand awareness and company profile / reputation as
        important

        - • easy to count numbers not so easy to count overall service delivery, organisational culture,
        - intellectual capital, strength of customer relationships ethical / unethical activities.

        - • qualitative information using words and pictures reviewing feelings and behaviours will
        -   enhance any measure of business performance.
       
        # • quantitative information and performance measures are important
        # but over-reliance on these can skew any assessment of business
        # performance and give only a partial view.

Analyse why a train company might use a strategy of price
discrimination:
    • Price discrimination is a pricing strategy by a business to charge
    different prices to different customers for the same product. [2]

    • Price discrimination is not price differentiation such as different
    prices for different services such as first and second class. [1~2]

    • The train company may be able to segment its market into groups of
    passengers having similar characteristics. [1] Introduction
        • If able to keep these segments apart it can sell different-priced
        tickets according to their reasons for travel business and leisure.
        • Can be used to attract passengers at times when trains may not be
        filled to capacity e.g. off-peak.
        • Market conditions and operational opportunities provide a range of
        pricing options for the business.
        • The price elasticity of demand for a product (e.g. inelastic demand)
        may provide an opportunity for a business to adopt a price
        discrimination strategy.               [4] Body 

    • The train company can sell different-priced tickets and maximise
    revenue and potentially increase profits and profitability. [1] Evaluation

Discuss whether having a large product portfolio is an advantage to a
car manufacturer.

• Product portfolio is the range of products / services sold by a
business. [1]

    ̶ e.g. the business’ advantage over its competitors through
    higher sales, margins, number of customers, due to the size of
    its product portfolio (market share) [2]
    • A range of products (cars) can meet the needs of different
    customers  allowing sales in different geographical areas and to
    business and private customers. [2]
     e.g. meet the specific needs of an emerging economy with basic
    low-cost motoring.
    • Can provide basic and luxury models. [1]
    • Will need a broad range of models if seeking to provide for a
    segmented market(s)  more choice for customers. [2]
    • It spreads the risk  a decline in some products may be offset by
    offers. Link to product life cycle. [2]
    • A large product portfolio has the potential to generate high returns. [1]

    Evaluation:
    while it might be a competitive advantage,
    a large product portfolio has potential negative features:
    a single model or limited model production might be a safer and more
    profitable approach. [1]
    
    As having a large product portfolio means that business would need
    more different raw material which could increase costs of auditing
    as variable costs differ and inventory costs increase [1]

In recent years a significant number of businesses have been accused
of being unethical.
Discuss whether senior managers should consider ethics when making
business decisions.[20]

    Ethical decision-making  decisions taken with a reference point of
    morality  the ‘right’ (rather than ‘wrong’) decisions in relation to
    employees, customers, suppliers, the environment. [2]

    • Ethical decisions may increase costs and limit business activities.
    • There is increasing scrutiny of business behaviour and activities by
    outside agencies/pressure groups. 
     • Senior managers likely to take decisions that can have a significant
    impact on others (examples  exploitation, bribery, child labour).
    • Senior managers becoming more aware of consequences of
    unethical decisions  reputational damage (examples). [4]

    • Senior managers may see a competitive advantage in being ethical
    and stakeholders may have a greater expectation of ethical
    behaviour. Its importance may depend on a number of factors:
        Extent of stakeholder pressure.
        Values of senior managers and/or owners.
        What are other businesses doing? [1]
        
    # • Senior managers may make a risk assessment of ethical / unethical
    # decisions and will need to take account of external factors and the
    # unique situations experienced.

    Evaluation:
        • Does the need to avoid pressure group activity / government action
        (taxes and grants) put pressure on the senior manager?
        • Also answers may propose that internal concerns about reputation
        and brand image suggest that the extra short term costs of becoming
        more ethical can be outweighed by the likelihood of future long term
        benefits.

        answer may well refer to important business decisions such as
        relocation, changing suppliers, CSR, supply chains, code of conduct, brand
        reputation, purchase of fixed assets, production/output, HRM decision such
        as the difficulty/ease of attracting employees to the business.

Analyse why many human resource management departments have
developed policies for diversity and equality.

    • Definitions of diversity and equality:
    the acknowledgement and celebration of difference and
     the elimination of discrimination and increasing access for all in business.
    • Examples of policies for diversity and equality. [2~3]

    • In some countries the law now requires explicit policies relating to
    diversity and equality  businesses are required to comply. [1]
    • Many businesses now recognise the negative business 
    consequences of inequality and discrimination. [1]
    • HRM departments follow and reflect changing societal demands for
    more equality and diversity. [1]
    • Business are seen as a microcosm of society and HRM at forefront
    of attempts to produce inclusive environments and cultures in the
    work organisation. [1]
    • Seen by some as a competitive advantage to have operating
    policies of diversity and equality. [1]
        - Employees are more motivated as they feel socially safe from discrimination
        - and have equal pay with other employees. [1]

A significant investment in training and development is the best way to
improve employee effectiveness in a retail business.:

    Note: GIVE APPLICATION TO RETAIL BUSINESS OTHERWISE THEY WILL CORRECT UNTIL LEVEL 2
        WHICH IS [3~6] MARKS TOTAL

    • Training and development aims to strengthen and update employee
    job-related knowledge and skills. [1]
    • Retail is a ‘labour intensive’ business where customer service skills
    are critical. [2]
    • Training and development might be part of a motivation package to
    improve performance. [1]
    (how much to invest into training and development)
    
    Evaluation:

        • ‘Best way’ depends on a number of factors, e.g.
            the current state of employee performance
            is the extent of training and development comparable with competitors?
            the level and impact of pay
            past investment in training and development.

        • Could a more effective recruitment and selection process be more
        successful at improving employee performance?
        • It might be considered effective, but can the business afford a
        ‘significant’ level of investment in training and development (time
        and money). [4] ([4] Explaination and analysis)

    Evaluative comments may well consider that the ‘best way’ all depends on
    the particular time and circumstances of a business and discuss alternative
    ways of improving employee effectiveness in a retail business (such as more money).

Analyse the advantages of crowd funding as a source of finance for
small businesses.:

    • Small businesses typically have significant problems in raising funds.
    • The practice of funding a project / venture by raising monetary
    contributions from a large number of people, typically via the internet. [2]

    • Access to cheap(er) money for small and medium sized businesses.
    • May not have to pay interest or be repaid. 
    (However, in some instances crowd funding may have interest and repayment.) [1~2]
    • No need to sell an equity stake in the business.
    • Fast and flexible source of finance.
    • Allows many more speculative projects to be funded.
    • Supports business expansion. [2]
    • Acts as a marketing / brand tool.
    • May give feedback and advice to project fund seeker.
    • Entrepreneurs do not have to risk own money for a new venture. [2]

Financial measures are the most important indicators of business performance.:

    • financial measures of performance such as financial results data and
    ratio analysis.
    • Quantitative measures of business performance are important and strong
    answers may well outline the value of financial measures before discussing the
    case for including the qualitative performance measures. [2]

    • Financial measures could include the following: profit, cash flow, break
    even, liquidity (current ratio, acid test ratio), profitability (gross profit
    margin, net profit margin and return on capital employed). Reference
    may also be made to income statements and statements of financial position.

    - • Recognition of the limitations of financial data:
        and often too little emphasis on the qualitative drivers of performance,
        such as `innovation, quality, employee relations, intangible assets.`
        • Advantages of non-financial methods of performance measurement: –
        drivers to success are often intangible assets – customer loyalty –
        innovation, management capability, employee relations, brand value –
        may well compose a significant proportion of the value of a business.
        • Non-financial measures are more closely linked to long-term strategy of
        a business – the progress made towards reducing competition,
        increasing customer loyalty – while traditional measures are more short
        term.
    
    Evaluation:

        focus on the value and advantages of financial / quantitative measures and
        assess their performance.
        • Non-financial measures can be better indicators of the long term / future
        financial performance – R&D decisions made now may well produce
        longer term benefits – traditional measures do not capture this.

Analyse the impact of social enterprises on the development of a
country.

    social objectives that reinvest profit into social benefit activities.
    • Commercial businesses that aim to make a surplus in socially
    responsible ways and distribute any profit to society – business
    principles with social objectives – economic – social – environmental
    objectives – triple bottom line businesses. [3]

    • Social enterprises enrich the types of business units in a country –
    provide services that PLCs and other businesses cannot or do not want
    to provide – so important in developing a variety of business responses
    and objectives.

    • Examples of impact of social enterprises:
    – Provide finance for emerging entrepreneurial projects; allow small
    businesses to be set up; provide finance for environmental
    improvement; fill a gap when charities run out of funds;
    supplement key infrastructure systems.

    Evaluation:
        • This can be very important in stimulating the economy and giving a
        different emphasis to business objectives and opportunities.


The purchase of an internationally recognised fast food franchise
guarantees business success.

• Definition and advantage [2]
    – More chance of business success when using an established brand and product.
    – National / international promotion is available, often at nil or limited cost.
    – Training and advice offered by franchiser.
    – Location of business protected.
    – Supplies of food guaranteed in terms of quality and consistency.
• However, is a franchisee guaranteed success?
• There are significant costs to pay before ‘profit’ is achieved.
    • The business still needs to be effectively and efficiently managed
     e.g. quality of serving and food production employees – is there managerial capability 
    – what happens if the franchise business suffers as a result of
    recession in particular companies 
    – or reputation suffers customer tastes change?

• It also depends on what is meant by ‘business success’ – short-term –
long-term – profits – expansion?

Evaluation: 
    • Effective evaluation is likely to be evidenced by a consideration /
    discussion of the extent to which business success is likely to be
    guaranteed by a fast food franchise and of other factors which are
    associated with business success.
    (use examples given)
